For REINFORCE, the default learning rate is already set the one used to produce my results, so:

python reinforce.py --num-episodes 50000

For A2C, the default learning rates are already set to the ones I used in my results, so:

python a2c.py --num-episodes 50000 --n <N>

Both of these functions produce a results_<algorithm_name>_<setting>.json, which can be used to produce plots with:

python plot_<algorithm_name>.py
